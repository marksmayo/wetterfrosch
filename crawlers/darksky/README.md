# Dark Sky Crawler

This is the crawler for darksky.net

To get started, you need to obtain an API key [here](https://darksky.net/dev/register). The key will look something similar to this: `502f7076a7163067b9ea72516939b03e`. Write this key into a file named `token`. No other text is allowed to be in that file.

You should keep your API key secret.
